        <h2>A designer is first and foremost a human being</h2>
        <p>We are all human. When making designs keep this in mind. If building an ecommerce site do not just view the users as a income stream. If building informational sites do not trick people into buying things or doing things with the content. Always remember that you are influencing people and how they live their lives. Remember that your website viewers and users are more than just your income. They are people just like you are, and design should reflect this. </p>

        <h2>A designer is responsible for the work they put into the world</h2>
        <p>The things you build as a designer will be out there. Good, bad, or indifferent it will exist. Always build things trying to better the world do not make it worse. Create helpful, not harmful or misleading content.  If someone approaches you with a job that your ethics don’t align with, don’t take the job. The sites you help design are ultimately responsible for the good or bad that they cause. </p>

        <h2>A designer values impact over form</h2>
        <p>Sometime what looks great can still have bad effects on people. Just because the form looks good doesn’t mean its great design. Great design only comes about when the goals being achieved by the design are good and ethical as well. When it comes to design beauty is not just skin deep. Its whether or not the design helps or hurts people that matters most.</p>

        <h2>A designer owes the people who hire them not just their labor, but their counsel</h2>
        <p>As a designer you have the responsibility to the client to tell them things they may not want to hear. Don’t just be a YES man. If they want something done that you know will be bad do everything in your power to show them why without rocking the boat. You are being hired for your experience in design not just to put something together that they want.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "box">

        <h2>A designer welcomes criticism</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you will be wrong. Don’t be too prideful to take constructive criticism.  As painful as it can be to hear that you messed up or did something that doesn’t vibe well with the rest of the build it can also be a great learning experience. Be open to ideas and logical changes.</p>
        </div>


        <div class = "box">

        <h2>A designer strives to know their audience</h2>
        <p>It is important to know the people that will be involved in the project as well as the people viewing the finished product. Understanding the user is critical in making good designs. Do research into who will be looking at your design. Build the design with those users in mind. </p>
        </div>


        <div class = "box">

        <h2>A designer does not believe in edge cases</h2>
        <p>It is the job of the designer to try and make the design great for 100% of users not just 95% or 98% of users. Those last few percent of users should not be forgotten and should be accounted for in the design. As a designer you owe 100% of the users your best work, not just the majority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "box">

        <h2>A designer is part of a professional community</h2>
        <p>As a professional designer, how you hold yourself in front of others is a reflection of the profession as a whole. It is your responsibility to hold yourself to a high standard. Don’t throw other designers under the bus, don’t steal work and claim it as your own, and don’t lie to clients.  How you represent yourself as a designer is a greater representation of the UX design industry. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "box">

        <h2>A designer welcomes a diverse and competitive field</h2>
        <p>Throughout your career as a designer, you will come across newer designers looking to break into the field. Do your best to teach them when you can with no ego. Don’t limit the knowledge you have the ability to share based on someone’s background or looks. Be humble after all you started out just like these newer designers at one point in time. Be aware of your biases and keep them in check.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "box">

        <h2>A designer takes time for self-reflection</h2>
        <p>It’s easy to be ethical at the beginning. As time goes by though one little slip up can lead to another. From time to time, it is important to take a minute and reflect on your past choices and get a idea of whether they were ethical or not. If you find that you have been making some bad choices for one reason or another, get back on the right path. Refresh yourself to your ethics and realize that while you cannot change the bad choices you have already made you can certainly make better ones in the future. Stay true to yourself. If you have been lead astray get back on the right path. </p>
